<span class="c3">Working as a part of the Runtimes team I got a chanc <span class="c3">e to work on <span class="c3"> various parts of the Flash and AIR Runtimes. I got a chance to work various upcoming operating systems like Windows 8, Android and Palm WebOS as well as mature platforms like Windows Desktops and Windows Mobile. I also worked with the Netscape Plugin API and the ActiveX Plugin API.

#### Flash Intern at Adobe Systems Inc.  (May 27, 2008 – Aug 15, 2008)

<span class="c3">I was responsible for documenting and developing extensions for Adobe Mobile Client. <span class="c3">E <span class="c3">xtensions enabled ActionScript Programmers to call native functions on the  target device in effect making Action Script code as powerful as native code. I worked primarily on the N95 and developed extensions for exposing the Symbian GPS API into ActionScript.

#### Programmer at Zeus Learning Pvt. Ltd. (Aug 2006 – Jul 2007)

<span class="c3">Here, I worked on project  Liveta   - a speech recognition and verification project which helped non-native speakers learn a language and aimed at making them achieve native proficiency in it. My work involved research and study on speech verification systems as well as development and optimization of  speech recognition systems based on Hidden Markov Process  of  tri-phone based cepstral models. Programming was done using C/C++ and  Linux Multimedia APIs and on ARM processors. I also worked on project Enlite which is a Microsoft Office 2007 simulation. I was responsible for developing new application extensions which used complex state machines to drive learning and user experiance. This  project involved intensive programming using MFC and Windows API.



### Education

#### Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, USA. (Aug 07 – May 09)

#### Bachelor’s in Engineering from Mumbai University, India. (May 02 – Jul 06)



### Projects

#### Remote debugging/instrumentation environment for handhelds (Jan 08 – Dec 08)

<span class="c3">The project focuses on a debugger/instrumentation mechanism for  Augmented Reality applications on mobile devices. The debugger allows to monitor/log/record/playback the execution states of the program running on the remote device – this includes variable values, camera positions, and other live data.

#### Thread Scheduling library (Aug 07 – Sept 07)

<span class="c3">This library was made for the Linux platform and provided priority based co-scheduling to client threads in user space. Kernel level threads were used to simulate processors on which user threads would run.

#### Virtualized Kernel Driver (Sept 07 – Oct 07)

<span class="c3">Was a part of a team of two to develop a virtual camera driver for the linux kernel using User mode Linux as the test bed. We used a fixed bitmap to simulate the camera. The driver was a character device driver in Linux.

#### Multiplayer sports game – FerroSphere (Aug 07 – Nov 07)

<span class="c3">This was a class project for the Video Game Design class. The game was built on the C4 game engine provided for this course. The game could be player multiplayer with the networking support. The mechanics of the game were similar to those of soccer, but it had magnetic spindles in place of human players and the ball was made up of iron.

#### Peer to Peer File Sharing (Jan 06 – April 06)

<span class="c3">The system was an effort towards merging the file sharing architectures of Kazza and DC++. It offered services like finding multiple sources, pausing and resuming file downloads, remote file list browsing, etc. It used Java Remoting for searching and downloading. This project also received the first prize at the intra-college project competition.

### Tools and Technologies Exposure

Programming Languages: C/C++ , Java, some assembly.

OS APIs: Win32, Windows Mobile, Linux, Android, Palm WebOS.
