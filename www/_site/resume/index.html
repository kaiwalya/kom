<p><span class="c3">I was responsible for documenting and developing extensions for Adobe Mobile Client. <span class="c3">E <span class="c3">xtensions enabled ActionScript Programmers to call native functions on the  target device in effect making Action Script code as powerful as native code. I worked primarily on the N95 and developed extensions for exposing the Symbian GPS API into ActionScript.</span></span></span></p>

<h4 id="programmer-at-zeus-learning-pvt-ltd-aug-2006--jul-2007">Programmer at Zeus Learning Pvt. Ltd. (Aug 2006 – Jul 2007)</h4>

<p><span class="c3">Here, I worked on project  Liveta   - a speech recognition and verification project which helped non-native speakers learn a language and aimed at making them achieve native proficiency in it. My work involved research and study on speech verification systems as well as development and optimization of  speech recognition systems based on Hidden Markov Process  of  tri-phone based cepstral models. Programming was done using C/C++ and  Linux Multimedia APIs and on ARM processors. I also worked on project Enlite which is a Microsoft Office 2007 simulation. I was responsible for developing new application extensions which used complex state machines to drive learning and user experiance. This  project involved intensive programming using MFC and Windows API.</span></p>

<h4 id="thread-scheduling-library-aug-07--sept-07">Thread Scheduling library (Aug 07 – Sept 07)</h4>

<p><span class="c3">This library was made for the Linux platform and provided priority based co-scheduling to client threads in user space. Kernel level threads were used to simulate processors on which user threads would run.</span></p>

<h4 id="virtualized-kernel-driver-sept-07--oct-07">Virtualized Kernel Driver (Sept 07 – Oct 07)</h4>

<p><span class="c3">Was a part of a team of two to develop a virtual camera driver for the linux kernel using User mode Linux as the test bed. We used a fixed bitmap to simulate the camera. The driver was a character device driver in Linux.</span></p>
