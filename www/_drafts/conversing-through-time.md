I recently read some books explaining data driven decision making. The important message resonating through all the books was that decisions should be based on data and facts and not on expert opinions. Seems obvious, I know, but its worth keeping in mind when taking decisions of any kind - which is almost always. 

I read these books in the context of business and product development but then tried to apply some of the learnings to my own life - the one topic where I have a lot of "expert opinions". In the spirit of the message in these books I set out to answer questions about myself, is my vocabulary improving over time? What is the change in my outlook towards life or world view? How are my research interests changing? How about my writing skills.

While searching for data sources to answer these questions I stumbled upon [my blog](http://lifefresko.blogspot.com/) and my old orkut profile both of which I havent contributed to for 7 years! I read it and I was amazed to see the difference between my intuition and the evidence. Contrary to my belief, I have improved my writing a little. I dont play video games as much as I used to, I thought I did. 

This exercise also made me realize that I had no clean data source for the last 7 years of my life. Hence, this blog! Its purpose is to present the future me with data points.

Present me: Dude, you are crazy. Isnt this called introspection? Arent you just writing a diary? Why do you need a website written to node.js with a nginx reverse proxy for that?

Future me: Hey, its OK! It was 2014 and you thought all that was cool. Thats a great data point!
