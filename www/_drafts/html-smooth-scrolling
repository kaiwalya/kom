title: Delightful Scrolling
---

There are many reasons why scrolling is sometimes 'not so smooth'. One of the reasons for this is memory thrashing. 

### What is scrolling

Scrolling (derived from the word scroll) 

### Simple implementation - View and Viewport

Viewport with fully rendered view.

### Memory efficient view

Unload parts of the view which you do not want

### Physics

Dragging vs Flicks - force and mass
